# Portfolio


## Description

My motivation for this project was to learn how to make a webpage in which i could switch between pages by using a navigation bar or similarly linked buttons.  I needed to learn how to code buttons and links into my html files.  I built this project to satisfy the requirements obviously but I also built this code to help serve as my portfolio later on down the road.  I learned a lot of what not to due but I also gained a better understanding of how to use columns and rows and have the spacing needed for them.
